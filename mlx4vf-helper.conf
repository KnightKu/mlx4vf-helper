# Used by /sbin/mlx4vf-helper
#
# To enable Virtual Function interfaces on Mellanox NIC create
# /etc/modprobe.d/mlx4_core.conf
# and pass 'num_vf' and 'probe_vf' variables. Check mlx4_core modinfo for details.
# For example
#options mlx4_core num_vfs=1 probe_vf=1
#
# For 2 port NIC with 4 VFs on each
#options mlx4_core probe_vf=4,4 num_vfs=4,4

# For 4 port NIC with 4 VFs on each
# options mlx4_core probe_vf=4,4,4,4 num_vfs=4,4,4,4

# vf Interface renaming is enabled by default
# Uncomment the following to set empty variable and disable renaming

# Uncomment the following to bring the interface back up after renamig
#VF_UP_AFTER_RENAME=1

# optional set VLAN for each VF interface
# The interface namig convension is like this
# Format: <parentInterface>_vf<vfid>_VLAN=<VLAN_ID>
# Example:
